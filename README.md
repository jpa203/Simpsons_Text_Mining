# SimpsonsTextMining

This project was an attempt to derive key insights into the themes and trends of The Simpsons' Christmas Specials over the years. 

For this project, I used the tidy text library, along with some of the key text mining methods outlined by the library's authors, as explained in the ebook: "Text Mining with R".

The project was subsequently listed as a Medium article, with an explanation of methods and findings, here:
